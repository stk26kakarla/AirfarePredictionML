# Airfare prediction with Machine Learning

## Only for *Learn & Grow on the Go*
A sample project to predict airfares using various regressors. This project consists of 2 Python Notebooks. "FeatureEngineering.ipynb" is to determine features and labels, extend features, determine important features for price prediction; basically feature engineering. The 2nd notebook "MLModelTraingAndValidation.ipynb" preprocesses the data to make it readable for machines; i.e. label encoding and scaling then runs a training and validation on 5 regressors. One of them is the winner.

**Random Forest Regressor with R2 score _95.5_**
## Vision

The vision is to create a program that will use SkyScanner API to retrieve more airfares and with different intervals and train a ML model to predict possible cheap fligt rates for Indian domestic travel.

Next steps:
- Use SkyScanner API to fetch airfares of major cities for whole year 
- Create feature to determine local and public holidays
- Try XG and SVM regressors
- Deploy model and create relevant APIs
